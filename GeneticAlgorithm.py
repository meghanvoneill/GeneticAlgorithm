# This genetic algorithm makes use of biological and evolutional mechanisms to find a unique solution to a
# particular problem, carried out on gene- and chromosome-like data structures. The mechanisms mimic biological
# mechanisms such as genetic crossover, genetic mutation, fitness, and some limited population dynamics.
# This idea comes from Mat Buckland of AI-Junkie, who kindly wrote a tutorial on genetic algorithms.
